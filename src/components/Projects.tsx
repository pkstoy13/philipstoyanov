          Custom Shell Project created for Operating Systems Course. Was broken
          down into paheses during the course, with the first phase focusing on
          getting the shell running, creating the built-in commands for it, and
          allowing arguments to be passed into the shell. The 2nd phase was
          focused on more advanced features, such as giving the shell the
          ability to run scripts, and creating an accumulater function and
          environment variables.
